## Agile Methodology

### MoSCoW prioritization

In development process, I followed Agile principles to ensure flexibility and continuous improvement. I used the MoSCoW method to prioritize features and tasks. This method helped me to focus on what’s most important.

| Priority Level   | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Must Have**    | Essential features that are critical for the platform's core functionality and success.                |
| **Should Have**  | Important features that add significant value but can be delayed if necessary without major impact.    |
| **Could Have**   | Nice-to-have features that enhance the user experience but are not essential for the initial launch.    |
| **Won't Have**   | Features that are either not needed for this phase or have been deprioritized for future consideration. |

### GitHub Projects

I used GitHub Projects to organize and track my development progress. This helped me to manage tasks, prioritize work, and stay on schedule. My project board is divided into columns, such as "To Do", "In Progress", "Done", and "Won`t have" allowing me to visualize the workflow and ensure that nothing is left behind.

## Colour Schema

[Coolors](https://coolors.co) was used to create colour palette. The design of the application follows a modern and minimalistic color scheme, using a combination of dark and light shades to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The primary colors used throughout the application are:

![screenshot](documentation/readme/geektide-color-schema.png)

These colors were chosen to create a clean and professional look while maintaining good readability and accessibility across different devices and screen sizes.

## Images

All images used in this application have been sourced from [Pinterest](https://ie.pinterest.com/) They have been selected to complement the overall design and aesthetic of the project, providing visual context and enhancing the user experience.

## Typography

The application uses a combination of the following fonts to create a clean and modern look:

- **Open Sans:** This sans-serif font is the primary typeface used throughout the site for its readability and contemporary feel. It is employed for most of the body text and user interface elements.

- **Arial:** As a widely available and versatile sans-serif font, Arial is used as a fallback for text elements when Open Sans is not available.

- **Sans-serif:** A general sans-serif font family is used as a fallback to ensure text remains legible and consistent across different devices and browsers.

These fonts were chosen to maintain clarity, readability, and a cohesive design aesthetic across the application.
